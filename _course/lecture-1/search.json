    "text": "Why Study Logic?\nLogic is one of the few subjects to appear on nearly every philosophy curriculum worldwide. A student who is new to the subject may naturally wonder why this should be the case. Why, that is, should the study of logic be regarded as a necessary prerequisite to a philosophical education? Puzzlement on this score is sure to increase when, upon first entry into the study of logic, one is almost immediately confronted with formulas and equations that seem more at home in a course of mathematics than philosophy.\nOne potential source of confusion as to logic’s proper place within philosophy derives from the fact that what might be termed logicality—or the capacity to reason well—is no more necessary an intellectual virtue for the philosopher than it is for, say, the chemist, the historian, or the statistician. And yet in other disciplines one does not find logic being taught as its own subject. History students, for example, are expected to acquire a working knowledge of what counts as sound historical reasoning not through any direct instruction as to the principles of logic that apply in their field, but instead by studying the work of professional historians and undertaking to produce such work on their own. Indeed, even in the domain of mathematics, where sound reasoning is arguably constitutive of the discipline and not merely an aspect of its methodology, students, by and large, are provided with no special training in logic. Instead, a working knowledge of the methods of proof by which mathematicians establish theorems is viewed as a natural byproduct of a proper mathematical education.\nWhy then do philosophers approach the study of logic so differently? Why do they treat logic as having its own distinctive subject matter and not merely as a part of philosophical methodology? The answer, in short, is that reasoning, or argumentation, is not merely something that philosophers do and aspire to do well. It is also among the principal objects of philosophical scrutiny.\nThere is no more recognizably philosophical form of intellectual activity as that which results from the attempt to resolve the feeling of paradox that accompanies an apparently sound argument which leads to a manifestly absurd conclusion. For the philosopher, such paradoxes of reasoning are not merely something to be avoided in practice—which perhaps would be simple enough to achieve—they are also sources of potential insight. For they highlight the need for a more careful scrutiny of the various concepts implicated in our reasonings. Consider, for example, the following paradoxes, each of which has been made the subject of logical analysis and subsequently served as the starting point for a rich and fruitful line of philosophical inquiry:\nLater on in this course, we will have occasion to revisit each of these paradoxes, and discuss them in more detail. For now, let us focus on the last example of the sorites paradox, as it can be used to illustrate how philosopher’s employ the method of logical analysis to treat paradoxes of reasoning.\nWhen confronted by a paradox, the question one must ask is: where has the reasoning gone wrong? As a first step towards answering this question, it is natural to try to identify the principle assumptions that are being relied upon in the fallacious argument. In the case of the sorites paradox, the fallacy relies on the fact that there are certain properties—such as that of being a heap—which seem to exhibit the following features:\nIdentifying the core assumptions at work in a fallacy is a good start, but one must next explain how exactly these assumptions are utilized in the paradoxical argument to underwrite the fallacious conclusion. It is at this stage of the analysis that one typically resorts to the formalisms of logic to represent the reasoning more precisely.\nLet \\(H\\) (for “heap”) be a predicate which applies to the positive integers (\\(1,2,3,\\ldots\\)) and which is defined as follows: \\[\n  H(n) \\textrm{ iff an accumulation of $n$ grains of sand is a heap}\n\\]\nLet \\(l\\) be a large enough number such that \\(H(l)\\) is clearly true and let \\(s\\) be a small enough number such that \\(H(s)\\) is clearly false. Then, the paradoxical line of reasoning outlined above can be represented as follows:\nWhat is important about this representation of the reasoning is not the symbolic shorthand it utilizes but rather the clear separation it effects between the assumptions presupposed in the reasoning, given in lines 1 and 2 of the argument, and the patterns of reasoning employed to deduce from these assumptions the counterintuitive conclusion.\nThis general procedure whereby the material assumptions upon which an argument relies are made explicit and distinguished from the form of the reasoning involved in the argument, may be termed logical analysis. The methodological value of logical analysis for philosophy resides in the asymmetrical status that is generally afforded to the truth of the material assumptions, which may be questioned, and the underlying system of formal logic on which the argument is based, which is generally taken to be beyond reproach. If our analysis of an argument represents the reasoning as valid in a correct system of logic, then the fault in the reasoning must lie with one of the material assumptions.\nOf the two assumptions appearing in the sorites paradox, only the first, given in line 1 of the above argument, seems susceptible to doubt, and, indeed, many philosophers have claimed that, contrary to first appearances, it is, in fact, false. To accept such a claim, of course, one must rebut any argument which attempts to derive from the denial of the rejected assumption a further objectionable conclusion. One such argument discussed in the philosophical literature is the following:\nThe conclusion of this argument seems unacceptable. There simply cannot be a specific number \\(n\\) such that \\(n\\) grains of sand constitute a heap, but \\(n-1\\) grains of sand do not. If this is correct, then the above argument must be invalid, and the fault must lie with either the inference from line 1 to 2, or the inference from line 2 to 3. Either response introduces a variety of logical subtleties, but each has its defenders in the literature.4\nSuppose, however, that upon due reflection we find such considerations unconvincing and that we can discover no other satisfactory reason to reject any of the material assumptions which lead to the sorites paradox. Must we then admit what seems patently absurd, that only a few grains of sand consitute a heap? We are only compelled to accept this absurdity, if we acknowledge as valid the form of the argument by which this seemingly absurd conclusion was derived from the premises we now admit to be true. But nothing in philosophy is sacrosanct—not even logic—and alternative resolutions to the sorites paradox have been put forward which target the underlying form of the reasoning itself. One such approach, for example, involves building into our system of logic a constraint which restricts the number of claims of the form ‘\\(\\textrm{If }H(n)\\textrm{, then\n}H(n-1)\\)’ that can be appealed to in any single argumentative context.5 According to this approach, the paradoxical argument fails not because of the falsehood of one of its material assumptions but because any chain of reasoning long enough to extend from a heap to a handful of grains of sand is simply too long for the argument to count as valid.\nThe possibility of such revisionary logical critique might seem to call into question the value of undertaking a detailed study of any specific system of logic before first assessing its adequacy. However, there are certain systems of logic which, despite their limitations, have proven to be so powerful in their applications that they have come to be regarded as a sort-of ‘starter’s toolkit’ for logical analysis. These systems of logic include classical propositional logic, first-order quantificational logic, and the normal modal extensions thereof. A great deal of conceptual insight can be gained simply by formalizing arguments as derivations in these systems, and one can be certain that any proposed solution to a philosophical problem which calls for a significant revision to one of these systems is venturing into deep philosophical waters. Before daring such depths, it is therefore essential for any student of analytic philosophy to gain facility in working with these standard systems of logic and to come to understand both their inherent capacities and limitations. This is what we hope to achieve in this course.",

    "text": "Berry’s Paradox1\nThere are twenty-six letters in the English alphabet. Ignoring letter case and punctuation, and admitting one additional character to mark both the space between words and leading and trailing spaces, there are \\(27^{79}\\) expressions with fewer than eighty characters. The vast majority of these expressions will be nonsense expressions like: \\[\n\\textrm{asdlkjsdl goiwejrkwmfw sdsf se asfsd f}\n\\] A few will be intelligible noun phrases, such as: \\[\n\\textrm{The tallest building in Chicago}\n\\] or: \\[\n\\textrm{The present king of France}\n\\] A much smaller selection still will be noun phrases denoting positive integers, for example: \\[\n\\textrm{The sum of twelve and seventeen}\n\\] or: \\[\n\\textrm{The first prime number which exceeds the number of stars in the Milky Way}\n\\]\nNow, consider the class of all the positive integers denoted by expressions with fewer than eighty characters. Since the number of such expressions is finite, so too must be the class of positive integers they collectively denote. Hence, this class of positive integers, being finite, must have a largest member. Let this number be \\(N\\). It follows that \\(N+1\\) is the smallest positive integer not describable with fewer than eighty characters. But, if so, then \\(N+1\\) is describable with fewer than eighty characters, namely, by the phrase: \\[\n\\textrm{The smallest positive integer not describable with fewer than eighty\ncharacters} \\]\nThus, it seems, the number \\(N+1\\) is both describable and not describable with fewer than eighty characters, which is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\nThe Surprise Exam Paradox2\nA teacher announces to one of his students prior to the first meeting of class that at some point during the term the student will be given a surprise exam. The student replies to the teacher’s announcement by giving the following argument purporting to show that what the teacher has said cannot be true:\n\nThe surprise exam cannot be given on the last day of class. For if this were so then just prior to the last class, having attended all but the last day of class without receiving the exam, I would know that the exam will be administered that day, in which case it will not be a surprise. Neither, however, can the exam be given on the next-to-last day of class. For if this were so then just prior to the next-to-last class, having attended all but the last two days of class without receiving the exam and having already concluded that the exam cannot be given on the last day, I would know that the exam will be administered that day, in which case it will not be a surprise. Continuing in this way, it follows that no matter when the exam is given it cannot be a surprise.\n\nThe conclusion of the student’s argument is absurd since it is clearly possible for the teacher to administer one and only one surprise exam (on, say, the third day of class).\n\n\n\n\nThe Sorites Paradox3\nSome aggregations of sand are sufficiently numerous to constitute a heap, while others are not. And yet it is a feature of the property of being a heap that whether or not a particular aggregation of sand is a heap is unchanged by the addition or removal of a single grain. Now, consider a numerous enough aggregation of sand as to clearly constitute a heap. Remove from this heap one grain of sand at a time and ask at each stage of the process whether what remains is still a heap. If being a heap is always unchanged by the removal of a single grain of sand, then at each stage of the process, the heap remains a heap and the question ought to be answered in the affirmative. But, if we continue such reasoning for long enough, it will follow that even a few grains of sand constitute a heap, which is absurd.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether or not the property applies is invariant under small changes in the object to which it is applied.\nA large enough number of such small changes, if carried out in consecution, would result in a sequence of objects the first of which clearly possesses the property and the last of which clearly does not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(\\textrm{For all }n&gt;1\\textrm{: if }H(n)\\textrm{, then } H(n-1).\\)\nassumption\n\n\n\\(2\\)\n\\(H(l)\\)\nassumption\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(\\textrm{If }H(l)\\textrm{, then }H(l-1)\\)\nfrom: \\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(4\\)\n\\(H(l-1)\\)\nfrom: \\(2, 3\\)\n\n\n\\(5\\)\n\\(\\textrm{If }H(l-1)\\textrm{, then }H(l-2)\\)\nfrom: \\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(6\\)\n\\(H(l-2)\\)\nfrom: \\(4, 5\\)\n\n\n\\[\\vdots\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n\\(\\textrm{If }H(s+1)\\textrm{, then }H(s)\\)\nfrom: \\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(n+1\\)\n\\(H(s)\\)\nfrom: \\(n-1, n\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 1 Express the line number \\(n\\) in terms of \\(l\\) and \\(s\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(\\textrm{It is not true that: for all }n&gt;1\\textrm{, if }H(n)\\textrm{, then } H(n-1).\\)\nassumption\n\n\n\\(2\\)\n\\(\\textrm{It is true that: for some }n&gt;1\\textrm{, }H(n)\\textrm{ but not } H(n-1).\\)\nfrom: \\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(\\textrm{For some }n&gt;1\\textrm{, it is true that: }H(n)\\textrm{ but not } H(n-1).\\)\nfrom: \\(2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 Read one of the articles listed in the References section of this Introduction.",

    "text": "The first presentation of Berry’s Paradox appears in Russell (1908). Boolos (1989) presents a concise proof of Gödel’s incompleteness result based on a formalization of Berry’s Paradox.↩︎\nThe surprise exam paradox, originally described as the paradox of the “unexpected hanging”, first appeared in Martin Gardner’s March 1963 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine (reprinted in Gardner (1991)). Philosophical discussions of the paradox appear in Quine (1953) and Kripke (2011).↩︎\nThe name sorites derives from the Greek σωρός meaning “heap” (as in a heap of sand). The paradox is attributed to Eubulides (4th c. BCE) of Miletus, a philosopher of the Megarian school. It has since become a central topic of discussion in the philosophy of language and logic, and has inspired a vast literature on the issue of conceptual vagueness.↩︎\nFor an analysis of the paradox that rejects the inference from line 1 to 2, noting its invalidity in intuitionistic logic, see Putnam (1983). The most common grounds for rejecting the inference from line 2 to 3 involves the adoption of a supervaluationist semantics such as that described in Fine (1975) and Keefe (2000).↩︎\nOne proposal for how to develop such a logic is given in Gaifman (2010).↩︎",
