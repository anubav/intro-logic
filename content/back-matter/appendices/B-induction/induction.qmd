# Induction {#sec-induction .appendix}

## Inductive Definitions

It will often be the case that we wish to prove a claim to the effect
that every member of a given set possesses a certain property. The method of
induction is among the standard techniques employed in mathematics for proving
such claims. It will be utilized on many occassions throughout this course. 

Before describing the method of induction in general terms, let us
first see how it is applied in the context of a specific problem. Consider the following claim:

:::{#thm-primes .theorem}
Every natural number greater than 1 is the product of one or more primes.
:::

This theorem asserts that all the members of the set $\{2,3,4,\ldots\}$ have
the property of being expressible in the form $n_1\times n_2\times \cdots\times n_k$, where $k\geq 1$ and each of the $n_i$'s is a prime number (i.e., a number
that is greater than $1$ and divisible by only $1$ and itself). The following
proof of this theorem proceeds by the method of induction:

:::{.proof} 
Let $n$ be a natural number greater than $1$. If $n=2$, then the
proposition holds since $2$ itself is a prime number. Now, suppose $n>2$ and
that the claim holds for all $m$, such that $1 < m< n$. If $n$ is prime, then
the claim obviously holds. If, on the other hand, $n$ is not prime, then $n$ is
the product of two numbers $m$ and $l$, where $1 < m < n$ and $1 < l < n$. But
since, by assumption, $m$ and $l$ are both the product of one or more primes,
$n$ must likewise be the product of one or more primes, namely, those primes whose
product is $m$ and those whose product is $l$. This completes the proof.
:::

The reasoning carried out in this proof can be broken down into the following three steps:

1. It is first shown that the property ascribed in the theorem to all natural numbers greater than $1$ is possessed, in particular, by the number $2$. 

2. It is next shown that, for any number $n>2$, if the property is possessed by all numbers $m$ such that $1 < m < n$, then the property is possessed by the number $n$, as well.

3. It is then concluded (on the basis of 1 and 2 above) that the property is possessed by all natural numbers greater than $1$, i.e., that the theorem is true. 

How does claim 3 follow from claims 1 and 2? From claim 1, we know that the theorem holds for all members of the set:
$$
\{2\}
$$

But, from claim 2, we know that if the proposition holds for $n=2$, then it holds for $n=3$, as well. Thus, from claims 1 and 2, taken together, it follows that the proposition holds for all members of the set:
$$
    \{2, 3\}
$$

But again from claim 2 we know that if the proposition holds for both $n=2$
and $n=3$, then it also holds for $n=4$. Thus, from claims 1 and 2 together, it
follows that the claim holds for all members of the set:
$$
    \{2, 3, 4\}
$$
Since such reasoning can obviously be continued indefinitely, and at each stage of the reasoning we add the next number in order of succession to the set of numbers known to satisfy the theorem, we can conclude that the theorem holds for all numbers greater than $1$.

This is reasoning by induction. Note that this sort of reasoning takes advantage
of the fact that the set of natural numbers greater than $1$ can be 'built up'
through the repeated application of a certain rule or procedure applied to the
set $\{2\}$. In particular, this set can be generated from the
set $\{2\}$ by repeatedly applying the following rule:

For any $n$, check to see whether all of the numbers between $2$ and $n-1$ (inclusive) belong to the set. If so, add to the set the number $n$.

An inductive definition of a set is a definition which characterizes that set as
the end result of the repeated application of one or more rules or procedures to
some base set of objects. So, for example, the set $\mathbb{N}_{>1}=\{2,3,4,\ldots\}$ can be specified by the following inductive definition:

1. $2\in \mathbb{N}_{>1}$

2. If $n\in \mathbb{N}_{>1}$, for all $n$ such that $1 < n <m$, then $m\in \mathbb{N}_{>1}$.

3. The only objects in $\mathbb{N}_{>1}$ are those which can be proved to be so by appealing to 1 and 2.

The first clause of this definition specifies that the base set from which
$\mathbb{N}_{>1}$ will be generated is the set $\{2\}$. The second clause
describes $\mathbb{N}_{>1}$ as the result of repeatedly applying the above
rule. The third clause states that unless an object is either in the base set or
is placed in the set at some stage of the process of repeatedly applying this
rule, it is not in the set. In other words, clause (3) asserts that
$\mathbb{N}_{>1}$ is the 'smallest' set that satisfies conditions (1) and
(2). In most cases, clause (3) will simply be taken for granted and omitted from the inductive
definition.

It is important to stress that a single set may be given multiple distinct
inductive definitions. Consider, for example, the following two inductive
definitions of the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$:

:::{#def-natural-numbers-1} 
The set of natural numbers is the set $\mathbb{N}$ defined inductively as
follows:

1. $1\in \mathbb{N}$

2. If $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then $n+1\in \mathbb{N}$.
:::

:::{#def-natural-numbers-2}
The set of natural numbers is the set $\mathbb{N}$ defined inductively as follows:

1. $1\in \mathbb{N}$

2. If $n, m\in \mathbb{N}$, then $n+m\in \mathbb{N}$.
:::

In both of these definitions, the base set of the induction is the set $\{1\}$.
However, in the first case, $\mathbb{N}$ is described as being built up from
this base set by means of the following construction:

$$
    \{1\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,2,3\}, \ldots,\{1,2,\ldots,n\},\ldots
$$

In the second case, the construction of the set $\mathbb{N}$ proceeds as follows:

$$
    \{1\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,2,3,4\},\ldots, \{1,2,\ldots,2^n\},\ldots
$$

## Proof by Induction {#sec-proof-by-induction}

One of the main advantages of defining sets inductively is that such definitions
can provide a straightforward means of proving that a certain property is
possessed by every member of the defined set. In particular, if a
set is defined inductively, then it suffices to show that:

1.  Every member of the base set has the property.

2.  The property is preserved under each of the rules by which the set is
    constructed. In other words, if all objects to which the rule is applied
    possess the property in question, then any new objects which belong to the
    set in accordance with the rule have that property as well.

A proof that every member of an inductively defined set possesses a certain
property that proceeds by showing 1 and 2 is called a proof by induction, or
an inductive proof. One example of an inductive proof is the proof of the theorem stated at the beginning of this appendix. Here is another:

:::{#thm-proof-by-induction .theorem .unnumbered}
For any natural number $n$:

$$ 1+2+\cdots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$ 

:::{.proof} 
The proof proceeds by induction on the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$.[^inductive-def] We first observe that the claim holds for $n=1$:

$$
 1 = \frac{1(2)}{2}
$$

Now, suppose that the claim holds for some arbitrary $n$, where $n\geq 1$. Then:
$$
\begin{align}
        1 + 2 + \cdots + n + (n + 1) & = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + (n + 1)\quad \\
                                     & = \frac{n(n + 1) + 2(n + 1)}{2}\:   \\
                                     & = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}
\end{align}
$$

[^inductive-def]: More precisely, the proof proceeds by induction on the set
$\mathbb{N}$ as defined by the first of the two inductive definitions given
above. When an inductive proof relies on an obvious or otherwise well-known
inductive definition of a set, or when this definition can be straightforwardly
inferred from the proof itself, it will often be omitted for the sake of
brevity. 
:::

While an inductive proof such as this may seem like magic, much of the challenge
of supplying inductive proofs in mathematics consists in identifying a suitable 
inductive definition for the set in question.

## Unique Decomposition {#sec-unique-decomposition .appendix}

One useful way of conceptualizing the members of an inductively defined set is in terms of a formation tree.

:::{#def-formation-tree .definition}
With respect to an inductive definition of a set $S$, a _formation tree_ for an object $x\in S$ is a finite tree structure, whose nodes are objects in $S$, satisfying the following three conditions:
    
1. The root node of the tree (i.e., the unique node with no parents) is $x$.
     
2. If $x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}$ are the direct descendants (in order from left to right) of the node $y$, then $y$ is the result of applying one of the rules in the given inductive definition to $x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}$.

3. Every terminal node is a member of the base set of the inductive definition.
:::

While it is true that every object belonging to an inductively defined set has a
formation tree, it need not be the case that every object in the set has a
_unique_ formation tree. The property which asserts of an inductive definition
that every object in the inductively defined set does indeed have a unique
formation tree is referred to as the property of unique decomposability.

:::{#def-unique-decomposability .definition} 
An inductive definition of a set $S$ is _uniquely decomposable_ if every $x\in S$ has exactly one formation tree with respect that definition. 
:::

 It is important to stress that the property of being uniquely decomposable is a
 property of an inductive definition of a set and _not_ of the set itself. To
 emphasize this point, consider the two distinct inductive definitions of the
 set of natural numbers given above. It is easy to verify that while the first
 of these inductive definitions is uniquely decomposable, the second is not. The
 number $6$, for example has exactly one formation tree relative to the first
 definition, namely:

![](/content/static/images/unique-formation-tree.svg){fig-align="center" width=10 fig-alt="Unique Formation Tree"}

On the other hand, the number $6$ has many distinct formation trees relative to the second definition, for example:

![](/content/static/images/multiple-formation-trees.svg){fig-align="center" width=600 fig-alt="Multiple Formation Trees"}

Unique decomposability is important because we often wish to assign values to
the objects in a set by means of some inductive procedure. Suppose, for example,
that we wish to assign the properties 'odd' and 'even' to the natural numbers by requiring our assignment to satisfy the following three conditions:

1.  The number 1 is an odd number.

2.  If the number $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even.

3.  If the number $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd.

How do we know that conditions 1--3 are mutually consistent? How, that is, can
we be sure that they do not together entail that a single number is both even
and odd? Note that, taken together, these conditions amount to a description of
how the values 'odd' and 'even' propoagate upwards through a formation tree
relative to the first inductive definition of $\mathbb{N}$. The first condition
assigns values to the terminal nodes in such a tree, and the second and third
state how the value of a non-terminal node in the tree depends on the value
assigned to its direct descendant.

In this way, the root node of every formation tree is assigned a definite value.
For example, proceeding upwards through the formation tree for the number 6, we
have, by (1), that 1 is an odd number, and so, by (2), that 2 is an even number,
and so, by (3), that 3 is an odd number, and so forth. In this way, we are led
to the conclusion that 6 is even. How do we know that these conditions do not
also entail that the number 6 is odd? We know this because 6 has a _unique_
formation tree relative to this inductive definition. If, instead, the number 6
had multiple distinct formation trees, then it could very well be the case that
propagating values upwards through these different trees would yield different
results.
