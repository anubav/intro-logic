### The Surprise Exam Paradox[^surprise-exam]

A teacher announces to one of his students prior to the first meeting of class
that at some point during the term the student will be given a surprise exam.
The student replies to the teacher's announcement by giving the following
argument purporting to show that what the teacher has said cannot be true:

> The surprise exam cannot be given on the last day of class. For if this
> were so then just prior to the last class, having attended all but the
> last day of class without receiving the exam, I would know that the exam
> will be administered that day, in which case it will not be a surprise.
> Neither, however, can the exam be given on the next-to-last day of class.
> For if this were so then just prior to the next-to-last class, having
> attended all but the last two days of class without receiving the exam and
> having already concluded that the exam cannot be given on the last day, I
> would know that the exam will be administered that day, in which case it
> will not be a surprise. Continuing in this way, it follows that no matter
> when the exam is given it cannot be a surprise.

The conclusion of the student's argument is absurd since it is clearly possible
for the teacher to administer one and only one surprise exam (on, say, the third
day of class).

of the "unexpected hanging", first appeared in Martin Gardner's March 1963
Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine (reprinted in

@Quine1953-cz and @Kripke2011-ny.
