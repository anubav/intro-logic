### Multiplying 0's and 1's - Syntax

In this example, we introduce a formal language $L_\times$ suitable for
expressing a very simple class of arithmetical arguments, namely, those which
only consist of equations involving a single variable $x$ and in which both
sides of the equality are expressed as the product of numbers belonging to the
set $\{1,0\}$.

The alphabet for our language consists of the five symbols:
$$
x, 1, 0, \times, = 
$$

 We refer to the symbols $x$, $1$, and $0$ as
_numerals_.

A _numerical expression_ is any expression which can be proven to be so by appeal to the following two facts:[^inductive]

1. Every expression consisting of a single numeral is a numerical expression.

2. If $\al$ and $\be$ are numerical expressions, then the expression $\al \times \be$ is a numerical expression.
:::

[^inductive]: This is our first example of an inductive definition. For more on inductive definitions and the proofs by induction that they facilitate, see @sec-induction. 

It follows from this definition that the numerical expressions are all and only the expressions of the form:
$$
n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k
$$
where $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ are numerals.

The sole grammatical rule for the language is as follows: an expression is a _sentence_ of the language if it is of the form $\al=\be$, where $\al$ and $\be$ are numerical expressions. In accordance with this rule, the following expressions are all sentences of the language:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
(i) $x=0$
(ii) $1= x$
(iii) $1\times 0=0\times 1$
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
(iv) $x\times x=1$
(v) $x \times 0 \times 1 \times x = 1$
(vi) $x \times 1\times 1 \times 1 = 1\times x\times 0$

An example of an argument expressed in this language is:
$$
x\times 0 = 0\times 1,\hspace{0.1in} 1\times x\times 1 = 1\proves 1=x
$$
