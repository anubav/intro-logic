### Multiplying 0's and 1's - Semantics {.unnumbered}

In this example, we introduce a semantics in which to assess the validity of arguments expressed in the language $L_\times$ introduced in @exm-0x1-syntax. 

The only non-logical element of the syntax is the numeral $x$. We stipulate that
the possible semantic values of this symbol are given by the set of symbols
$\{0,1\}$.[^autonomic] Thus, there are only two possible interpretations of
the language, one in which $x$ is assigned the value $0$ and one in which $x$ is
assigned the value $1$. We refer to these interpretations as $\sigma_0$ and
$\sigma_1$, respectively.

[^autonomic]: It may seem odd to allow the semantic value of a symbol in the
language to be another symbol in the language, but, formally, there is nothing
to prevent us from doing so. Moreover, such an 'autonymic' semantics will allow us to speak intelligibly of the expression which results from substituting the
semantic value of the expression $x$ for all occurrences of $x$ in a given expression.

The semantic rules for the language must define a unique valuation for each of
these two interpretations. In formulating these rules, we will take for granted
that we know what it is for a sentence in the language which only involves the
numerals '0' and '1' to be a true (or false) arithmetical claim. The one and
only semantic rule for the language is as follows:

For $i=0,1$, $val^{\sigma_i}(\ph)=\true$ iff the sentence which results from
subtituting $\sigma_i(x)$ for all occurrences of $x$ in $\ph$ expresses a true
arithmetical claim.

To see how this rule is to be applied, let $\ph$ be the sentence:
$$
    x\times 1 = 1\times 0
$$

According to the rule, $val^{\sigma_0}(\ph)=\true$
just in case the sentence which results from substituting $\sigma_0(x)$ for
every occurrence of $x$ in $\ph$ is a true arithmetical claim. In this instance,
since $\sigma_0(x)$ is the symbol $0$, the sentence resulting from this
substitution is:
$$
0\times 1 = 1\times 0
$$

This, of course, is a true arithmetical claim, hence
$val^{\sigma_0}(\ph)=\true$. On the other hand, $val^{\sigma_1}(\ph)=\false$,
since
$$
1\times 1 = 1\times 0
$$

is arithmetically false.  

In this semantics, it is easy to verify that

$$
x\times 0 = 0\times 1,\hspace{0.1in} 1\times x\times 1 = 1\models 1=x,
$$

for the only intepretation under which all the premises of the argument are true
is $\sigma_1$, and the sentence $1=x$ is true under this interpretation as well.

 It will often be convenient to assign semantic values not just to the
 non-logical elements of the syntax but also to certain expressions containing
 these elements (or, equivalently, to treat these expressions themselves as the
 non-logical elements of the syntax). Thus, for example, with respect to the
 language $L_\times$, it will be convenient to be able to refer not just to the
 semantic value of the numeral $x$ under a given interpretation, but, more
 generally, to the value of any numerical expression under a given
 interpretation.
 
Let $\al$ be a numerical expression. For $i=0,1$, let $\sigma_i(\al)=0$ if
the result of substituting $\sigma_i(x)$ for each occurrence of $x$ in $\al$ is
an arithmetical expression which evaluates to $0$. Otherwise, $\sigma_i(\al)=1$.
Adopting this notation, the above semantic rule can now be expressed as
follows:

For $i=0,1$, $val^{\sigma_i}(\al=\be)=\true$ iff $\sigma_i(\al)=\sigma_i(\be)$.
