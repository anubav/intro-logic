### Berry's Paradox[^berry] 

There are twenty-six letters in the English alphabet. Ignoring letter case and punctuation, and admitting one additional character to mark both the space between words and leading and trailing spaces, there are $27^{79}$ expressions with fewer than eighty characters. The vast majority of these expressions will be nonsense expressions like:
$$
\textrm{asdlkjsdl goiwejrkwmfw sdsf se asfsd f}
$$
A few will be intelligible noun phrases, such as:
$$
\textrm{The tallest building in Chicago}
$$
or:
$$
\textrm{The present king of France}
$$
A much smaller selection still will be noun phrases denoting positive integers, for example:
$$
\textrm{The sum of twelve and seventeen}
$$
or:
$$
\textrm{The first prime number which exceeds the number of stars in the Milky Way}
$$

Now, consider the class of all the positive integers denoted by expressions with
fewer than eighty characters. Since the number of such expressions is finite, so
too must be the class of positive integers they collectively denote. Hence, this
class of positive integers, being finite, must have a largest member. Let this
number be $N$. It follows that $N+1$ is the smallest positive integer not
describable with fewer than eighty characters. But, if so, then $N+1$ _is_
describable with fewer than eighty characters, namely, by the phrase: $$
\textrm{The smallest positive integer not describable with fewer than eighty
characters} $$

Thus, it seems, the number $N+1$ is both describable and not describable with
fewer than eighty characters, which is a contradiction.

@Boolos1989-cs presents a concise proof of Gödel's incompleteness result based
on a formalization of Berry's Paradox.
