a. Suppose that we  wish to assign to the natural numbers the properties 'black' and 'red' in accordance with the following conditions:

    1. The number 1 is red.

    2. If $n$ and $m$ are both red, then $n+m$ is black.

    3. If either $n$ or $m$ is black, then $n+m$ is red.

    4. No number is both red and black.

    Are these conditions consistent?

b. Consider the following two conditions:

    5.  If $n$ and $m$ are either both red or both black, then $n+m$ is black.

    6.  If $n$ is red and $m$ is black, then $n+m$ is red.

    Show that conditions 1, 4, 5, and 6 are consistent.
