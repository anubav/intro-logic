For any $n$-ary truth function $g$, we refer to the function:
$$
g^d(\al_1,\ldots,\al_n) = f_{\neg}(g(f_\neg(\al_1),\ldots,f_\neg(\al_n)))
$$
as the _dual_ of $g$. With each sentence $\ph$ expressible in $\{\neg,\conj,\disj\}$ we associate a sentence $\ph_d$, referred to as the
_dual_ of $\ph$, as follows:

1. If $\ph$ is an atomic sentence, then $\ph^d=\ph$. 

2. $(\neg\ph)^d = \neg(\ph^d)$

3. $(\ph\conj\psi)^d = \ph^d\disj\psi^d$

4. $(\ph\disj\psi)^d = \ph^d\conj\psi^d$

a. 
    Show that if $g$ is the $n$-ary truth function for some sentence $\ph$ expressible in
    $\{\neg,\conj,\disj\}$, then $g^d$ is the $n$-ary truth function for $\ph^d$. Convince yourself
    that for any sentences $\ph$ and $\psi$ expressible in $\{\neg,\conj,\disj\}$, $\ph\equiv \psi$ if and only if $\ph^d\equiv \psi^d$.\vspace{2mm}

b. 
    A sentence $\ph$ expressible in  $\{\neg,\conj,\disj\}$ is _self-dual_ if
    $\ph\equiv\ph^d$. Provide an example of a self-dual sentence containing more than one atom that is expressible in
    $\{\conj,\disj\}$.
