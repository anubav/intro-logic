We refer to the number of symbols in an expression of $L_\times$ as the _length_
of that expression. 

(a). Show that the length of every sentence of $L_\times$ is odd.

(b). Show that the number of numerals in a sentence is exactly one greater than
the number of non-numerals in that sentence.

(c). Write down a formula expressing the length of any given
sentence as a function of the number of times the symbol $\times$ occurs in it.

(d).$^*$ If $k$ is an odd number greater than 2, how many distinct expressions
are there of length $k$? How many distinct sentences are there of length $k$?
Show that the probability that a randomly chosen expression of length $k$ is a
sentence approaches $0$ as $k$ grows increasingly large.
