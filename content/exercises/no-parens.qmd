Suppose that we omit parentheses from our language and instead define the sentences inductively as
follows:

1. Any expression consisting of a single atom is a sentence.
    
2. If $\ph$ is a sentence, then the expression $\neg \ph$ is a sentence.
  
3. If $\ph$ and $\psi$ are sentences and $\ast$ is a binary connective, then the expression
$\ph\ast\psi$ is a sentence. 

Show that the following three conditions are mutually inconsistent, i.e., show that they entail that, for some interpretation, the same sentence is assigned both  $\true$ and $\false$.

(S1$^*$):
If $\ph$ is an atomic sentence, then $val^\si(\ph)=\si(\ph)$.

(S2$^*$): 
For any sentence $\ph$:
$$
val^\si(\neg\ph)=f_\neg(val^\si(\ph))
$$

(S3$^*$):
For any sentences $\ph$ and $\psi$ and any binary connective $\ast$:
$$
val^\si(\ph\ast\psi)=f_\ast(val^\si(\ph),val^\si(\psi))
$$
