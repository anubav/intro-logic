If we wish to omit the parentheses from our language in a manner which preserves unique
decomposability, we can adopt what is called a prefix (rather than the standard infix) notation for expressing
propositional compounds. This prefix notation is sometimes referred to as Polish
notation. 

In Polish notation, we define the sentences of the language inductively as follows:

1. Any expression consisting of a single atom is an (atomic) sentence.
    
2. If $\ph$ is a sentence then $\neg \ph$ is a sentence.

3. If $\ph$ and $\psi$ are sentences and $*$ is a binary connective, then the expression $\ast \ph
\psi$ is a sentence.

a. Show that no sentence in Polish notation is a proper prefix of any other.

b. 

    Use part (a) to show that the sentences expressed in Polish notation satisfy the unique
    decomposition theorem, i.e., for each sentence $\ph$ exactly one of the following holds:

    1. $\ph$ is an atomic sentence.

    2. There exists a unique sentence $\psi$, such that $\ph=\neg\psi$.

    3. There exist unique sentences $\psi$ and $\chi$ and a unique binary connective $*$, such that $\ph=*\psi\chi$.
