a. Write down a sentence which is a logical truth iff $\ph_1,\ldots,\ph_n\models\psi$. 

b. Write down a sentence which is a logical truth iff $\ph\equiv\psi$. 

c. Confirm that, for any sentences $\ph$ and $\psi$:
    $$
    \models (\ph\imp\psi)\disj(\psi\imp\ph)
    $$
    Does it follow that, for any two sentences $\ph$ and $\psi$, either $\ph\models\psi$ or $\psi\models\ph$?
