a. 
    Let $\ph_1,\ldots,\ph_n$ and $\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_m$ be any sentences of $\Lp$. Show that the sentence:
    $$
        (\ph_1\conj\cdots\conj\ph_n)\disj(\psi_1\conj\cdots\conj\psi_m)
    $$
    is logically equivalent to a conjunction of disjunctions of these sentences.

b. 
    Deduce from the fact that every sentence in $\Lp$ has a disjunctive normal form, that
    every sentence also has a _conjunctive_ normal form, i.e., that every sentence is
    equivalent to some sentence of the form:
    $$  
    (\ph_{1,1}\disj\cdots\disj \ph_{1,k})\conj \cdots \conj (\ph_{n,1}\disj\cdots\disj \ph_{n,k}),
    $$
    where $\ph_{i,j}$ is a literal.
