a. Let $\Hp^*$ be the proof system obtained from $\Hp$ by replacing the axiom schema P$3$ with the schema:
$$
(\ph\imp\psi)\imp(\neg\psi\imp\neg\ph)
$$
Show that not every instance of P$3$ is a theorem of $\Hp^*$. 

b. Let $\Hp^i$ ($i=1,2$) be the deductive system obtained from $\Hp$ by omitting the axiom schema P$i$. Show that not every instance of P$i$ is a theorem of $\Hp^i$.
