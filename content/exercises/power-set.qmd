The _power set_ of the set $X$, written $P(X)$, is the set of all subsets of $X$, i.e.:
$$
P(X) = \{Y: Y\subset X\}
$$

(a). Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$. How many members does $P(S)$ have? 

(b). How many members does $P(P(S))$ have?

(c). How many members does the power set of the empty set have?
