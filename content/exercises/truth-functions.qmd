a. How many $n$-ary truth functions are there?

b. 

    An $n$-ary truth function is _exchangeable_ if its value remains the same
    regardless of the order in which its $n$ arguments are given to it. Let $f$ be an exchangeable $2$-ary truth function satisfying:

    $$
    f(f(\al,\be),\ga) = f(\al,f(\be,\ga))
    $$

    for all truth values $\al, \be, \ga$. For $n\geq 1$, we define the $n$-ary truth function $f^n$
    inductively as follows:

    1. $f^1 = f$

    2. $f^n(\al_1,\ldots,\al_n) = f(f^{n-1}(\al_1,\ldots,\al_{n-1}), \al_n)$

    Show that $f^n$ is exchangeable, for all $n\geq 1$.
