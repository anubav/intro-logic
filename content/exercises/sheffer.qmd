a. Prove that $f_\imp$ is not expressible in $\{\conj,\disj\}$.

Let $\uparrow$ be the binary propositional connective, whose corresponding truth function is given
by:
$$
    f_\uparrow(\al,\be)=f_\neg(f_\conj(\al,\be))
$$
and let $\downarrow$ be the binary propositional connective, whose corresponding truth function is given by:
$$
    f_\downarrow(\al,\be)=f_\neg(f_\disj(\al,\be))
$$

b. Show that $\{\uparrow\}$ and $\{\downarrow\}$ are truth functionally complete.

c. Let $\ast$ be any binary propositional connective. Show that if  $\{\ast\}$ is truth functionally complete, then $\ph*\psi$ is equivalent to
either $\ph\uparrow \psi$ or $\ph\downarrow\psi$.
