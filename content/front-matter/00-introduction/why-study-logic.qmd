## Why Study Logic?

Logic is one of the few subjects to appear on nearly every philosophy curriculum
worldwide. A student who is new to the subject may naturally wonder why this
should be the case. Why, that is, should the study of logic be regarded as a
necessary prerequisite to a philosophical education? Puzzlement on this score is
sure to increase when, upon first entry into the study of logic, one is almost
immediately confronted with formulas and equations that seem more at home in a
course of mathematics than philosophy.

One potential source of confusion as to logic's proper place within philosophy
derives from the fact that what might be termed _logicality_---or the capacity
to reason well---is no more necessary an intellectual virtue for the philosopher
than it is for, say, the chemist, the historian, or the statistician. And yet in
other disciplines one does not find logic being taught as its own subject.
History students, for example, are expected to acquire a working knowledge of
what counts as sound historical reasoning not through any direct instruction as
to the principles of logic that apply in their field, but instead by studying
the work of professional historians and undertaking to produce such work on
their own. Indeed, even in the domain of mathematics, where sound reasoning is
arguably constitutive of the discipline and not merely an aspect of its
methodology, students, by and large, are provided with no special training in
logic. Instead, a working knowledge of the methods of proof by which
mathematicians establish theorems is viewed as a natural byproduct of a proper
mathematical education.

Why then do philosophers approach the study of logic so differently? Why do they
treat logic as having its own distinctive subject matter and not merely as a
part of philosophical methodology? The answer, in short, is that reasoning, or
argumentation, is not merely something that philosophers do and aspire to do
well. It is also among the principal _objects_ of philosophical scrutiny.

There is no more recognizably philosophical form of intellectual activity as
that which results from the attempt to resolve the feeling of paradox that
accompanies an apparently sound argument which leads to a manifestly absurd
conclusion. For the philosopher, such paradoxes of reasoning are not merely
something to be avoided in practice---which perhaps would be simple enough
to achieve---they are also sources of potential insight. For they highlight
the need for a more careful scrutiny of the various concepts implicated in our
reasonings. Consider, for example, the following paradoxes, each of which has
been made the subject of logical analysis and subsequently served as the
starting point for a rich and fruitful line of philosophical inquiry:

::: {.example #berry}
{{< include /content/inserts/berry.qmd >}}
:::

:::{.example #surprise}
{{< include /content/inserts/surprise-exam.qmd >}}
:::

:::{.example #sorites}
{{< include /content/inserts/sorites.qmd >}}
:::

Later on in this course, we will have occasion to revisit each of these
paradoxes, and discuss them in more detail. For now, let us focus on the last
example of the [sorites paradox](#sorites){.unstyled-link}, as it can be used to
illustrate how philosopher's employ the method of logical analysis to treat
paradoxes of reasoning.

When confronted by a paradox, the question one must ask is: where has the
reasoning gone wrong? As a first step towards answering this question, it is
natural to try to identify the principle assumptions that are being relied upon
in the fallacious argument. In the case of the sorites paradox, the fallacy
relies on the fact that there are certain properties---such as that of being a
heap---which seem to exhibit the following features:

1. Whether or not the property applies is invariant under small changes in the object to which it is applied.

2. A large enough number of such small changes, if carried out in consecution,
   would result in a sequence of objects the first of which clearly possesses the property and the last of which clearly does not.

Identifying the core assumptions at work in a fallacy is a good start, but one
must next explain how exactly these assumptions are utilized in the paradoxical
argument to underwrite the fallacious conclusion. It is at this stage of the
analysis that one typically resorts to the formalisms of logic to represent the
reasoning more precisely.

Let $H$ (for "heap") be a predicate which applies to the positive integers
($1,2,3,\ldots$) and which is defined as follows:

$$
  H(n) \textrm{ iff an accumulation of $n$ grains of sand is a heap}
$$

Let $l$ be a large enough number such that $H(l)$ is clearly true and let $s$ be
a small enough number such that $H(s)$ is clearly false. Then, the paradoxical
line of reasoning outlined above can be represented as follows:

:::{.lproof}

    1. \textrm{For all }n>1\textrm{: if }H(n)\textrm{, then } H(n-1). [assumption]
    2. H(l) [assumption]
    3. \textrm{If }H(l)\textrm{, then }H(l-1) [from: 1]
    4. H(l-1) [from: 2, 3]
    5. \textrm{If }H(l-1)\textrm{, then }H(l-2) [from: 1]
    6. H(l-2) [from: 4, 5]
    ...
    n. \textrm{If }H(s+1)\textrm{, then }H(s)  [from: 1]
    n+1. H(s) [from: n-1, n]

What is important about this representation of the reasoning is not the symbolic
shorthand it utilizes but rather the clear separation it effects between the
assumptions presupposed in the reasoning, given in lines 1 and 2 of the
argument, and the patterns of reasoning employed to deduce from these
assumptions the counterintuitive conclusion.

This general procedure whereby the material assumptions upon which an argument
relies are made explicit and distinguished from the form of the reasoning
involved in the argument, may be termed _logical analysis_. The methodological
value of logical analysis for philosophy resides in the asymmetrical status that
is generally afforded to the truth of the material assumptions, which may be questioned,
and the underlying system of formal logic on which the argument is based, which
is generally taken to be beyond reproach. If our analysis of an argument
represents the reasoning as valid in a correct system of logic, then the fault
in the reasoning must lie with one of the material assumptions.

Of the two assumptions appearing in the sorites paradox, only the first, given
in line 1 of the above argument, seems susceptible to doubt, and, indeed, many
philosophers have claimed that, contrary to first appearances, it is, in fact,
false.\footnote{For an analysis of the paradox that rejects the assumption
stated in line 2, see \cite{Unger1979-li}.} To accept such a claim, of course,
one must rebut any argument which attempts to derive from the denial of the
rejected assumption a further objectionable conclusion. One such argument
discussed in the philosophical literature is the following:

:::{.lproof}

    1. \textrm{It is not true that: for all }n>1\textrm{, if }H(n)\textrm{, then } H(n-1). [assumption]
    2. \textrm{It is true that: for some }n>1\textrm{, }H(n)\textrm{ but not } H(n-1). [from: 1]
    3. \textrm{For some }n>1\textrm{, it is true that: }H(n)\textrm{ but not } H(n-1). [from: 2]

:::

The conclusion of this argument seems unacceptable. There simply cannot be a
specific number $n$ such that $n$ grains of sand constitute a heap, but $n-1$
grains of sand do not. If this is correct, then the above argument must be
invalid, and the fault must lie with either the inference from line 1 to 2, or
the inference from line 2 to 3. Either response introduces a variety of logical
subtleties, but each has its defenders in the literature.[^sorites-truth]

[^sorites-truth]:
    For an analysis of the paradox that rejects the inference from
    line 1 to 2, noting its invalidity in intuitionistic logic, see @Putnam1983-ix.
    The most common grounds for rejecting the inference from line 2 to 3 involves
    the adoption of a supervaluationist semantics such as that described in
    @Fine1975-cq and @Keefe2000-gn.

Suppose, however, that upon due reflection we find such considerations
unconvincing and that we can discover no other satisfactory reason to reject any of
the material assumptions which lead to the sorites paradox. Must we then admit what seems
patently absurd, that only a few grains of sand consitute a heap? We are only
compelled to accept this absurdity, if we acknowledge as valid the form of the
argument by which this seemingly absurd conclusion was derived from the premises we now admit to be true. But nothing in philosophy is
sacrosanct---not even logic---and alternative resolutions to the sorites paradox have been put
forward which target the underlying form of the reasoning itself. One such approach, for example, involves building into our system of logic a constraint which
restricts the number of claims of the form '$\textrm{If }H(n)\textrm{, then
}H(n-1)$' that can be appealed to in any single argumentative
context.[^sorites-logic] According to this approach, the paradoxical argument
fails not because of the falsehood of one of its material assumptions but
because any chain of reasoning long enough to extend from a heap to a handful of
grains of sand is simply too long for the argument to count as valid.

[^sorites-logic]: One proposal for how to develop such a logic is given in @Gaifman2010-rk.

The possibility of such revisionary logical critique might seem to call into
question the value of undertaking a detailed study of any specific system of
logic before first assessing its adequacy. However, there are certain systems
of logic which, despite their limitations, have proven to be so powerful
in their applications that they have come to be regarded as a sort-of
'starter's toolkit' for logical analysis. These systems of logic include classical
propositional logic, first-order quantificational logic, and the normal modal
extensions thereof. A great deal of conceptual insight can be gained
simply by formalizing arguments as derivations in these systems, and one can be
certain that any proposed solution to a philosophical problem which calls for a
significant revision to one of these systems is venturing into deep
philosophical waters. Before daring such depths, it is therefore essential for
any student of analytic philosophy to gain facility in working with these standard
systems of logic and to come to understand both their inherent capacities and
limitations. This is what we hope to achieve in this course.
