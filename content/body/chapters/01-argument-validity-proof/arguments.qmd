## Arguments 

In psychological terms, an inference can be characterized as a rational
transition in thought. We think certain thoughts and, for reason of thinking
these thoughts, we are led to think something else. It is natural to regard the
thoughts involved in an inference as non-linguistic abstractions, distinct from
the specific sentences that may be used to express these thoughts in a
particular language. Thus, for example, one may wish to allow that one and the same thought, say, the thought that 'snow is white', can be
expressed in German and French by the sentences 'schnee ist weiß' and 'la neige est blanche',
respectively. Moreover, if two thinkers, one in German and one in French, were each to conclude from this that 'something is white'---'etwas ist weiß' or 'quelque chose est blanc'---then, it may well be said, that, despite their linguistic differences, both reasoners have drawn one and the same inference. 

Nevertheless, for the purpose of representing inferences as
mathematical objects, we will disregard the intuitive difference between an
inference in thought and its linguistic formulation and construe inferences as purely
syntactic constructs. In other words, we will represent an inference by a
particular collection of grammatically well-formed sentences expressed in a
given language.

We will refer to the syntactic objects representing inferences as _arguments_. An
argument is a collection of sentences, one of which is distinguished as that for
the sake of which the others are set forth. The distinguished sentence is
referred to as the argument's _conclusion_ and the sentences offered in its
support as the argument's _premises_. The specific syntax in which we will
formulate arguments will not be that of a natural language such as English but
instead that of an artificial language devised for the express purpose of
representing certain patterns of inference. 

We adopt this approach so as to minimize the syntactic complexity of the
arguments that we consider. The rules determining when a sequence of symbols in
the English alphabet (or a sequence of words in the English lexicon) constitute
a grammatically well-formed sentence are exceedingly complex, and much of this
complexity is unnecessary for capturing the differences in meaning that are
relevant for assessing the validity of the particular inferences with which we
will be concerned. For example, while there may be some subtle difference in
meaning between the sentences "John gave the letter to Mary" and "Mary was given
the letter by John", this difference in meaning, while relevant perhaps for
producing a desired literary effect, is altogether irrelevant for judging
whether or not it follows from this claim that, say, "Mary was given something
by someone". Consequently, to avoid overcomplicating the syntax, we will study
such inferential relations in a language whose grammar ignores the distinction
between active and passive voice constructions.

In each of the artificial languages that we will consider, the syntax of the
language will be introduced in two distinct stages:

1. First, we will specify an _alphabet_ for the language, i.e., a set of symbols. Any finite string of symbols from this alphabet will be referred to as an _expression_ of the language.
2. Second, we will specify _grammatical rules_ determining when a given expression is well-formed. A grammaticaly well-formed expression will be called a _sentence_ of the language.

Sentences, thus defined, are purely syntactic constructs. They are strings of
symbols devoid of any meaning. Of course, our choice of the syntax for a
language will in all cases be guided by semantic considerations. In other words,
we will always have in mind a certain conception of how various linguistic items
are to be interpreted and we will choose our syntax so as to ensure that the
sentences in the language consist only of expressions which, when given such an
interpretation, express meaningful claims. 

We are now ready for our first official definition, that of an _argument_:

::: {#def-argument data-re="arguments?" data-flags="gi"}
 An _argument in the language $L$ _ consists of (i) a possibly empty set of sentences of $L$, whose members are referred to as the argument's _premises_; and (ii) a sentence of $L$ referred to as the argument's _conclusion_. We denote the argument whose premises comprise the set of sentences $\Gamma$ and whose conclusion is the sentence $\varphi$, as follows:
  $$
    \Gamma\proves\ph 
  $$
:::

For the sake of readability, when expressing arguments, we will often omit the
outer braces from the premise set. Thus, for example, the argument whose
premises comprise the set $\{\ph_1,\ldots,\ph_n\}$ and whose conclusion is
$\psi$ may be written:

$$
 \ph_1,\ldots,\ph_n\proves\psi 
$$

More generally, if $\Ga_1,\ldots,\Ga_n$ are sets of sentences and $\ph_1,\ldots,\ph_m$ are sentences, we will write:

$$
\Ga_1,\ldots,\Ga_n,\ph_1,\ldots,\ph_m\proves\psi
$$

for the argument whose premises comprise the set $\Ga_1\cup\cdots\cup\Ga_n\cup\{\ph_1,\ldots,\ph_m\}$ and whose conclusion is $\psi$. In addition, we adopt the convention that if the premise set of an argument is the empty set, we will omit reference to it altogether, writing $\proves\ph$ in
place of $\emptyset\proves\ph$.
